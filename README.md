# 🏨 Hybrid Hotel Recommendation System

This project is a part of a **Travel Capstone Project** which implements a **Hotel Recommendation System** using a hybrid approach combining **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**. The final model is deployed as a **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to enter their user ID and receive top hotel recommendations.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains real user hotel bookings with the following features:

- `travelCode`: Unique travel transaction ID  
- `userCode`: Unique identifier for the user  
- `name`: Hotel name  
- `place`: Hotel location  
- `days`: Duration of stay  
- `price`: Cost per day  
- `total`: Total cost paid  
- `date`: Booking date

---

## ✅ Key Features

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed missing or duplicated entries  
- Converted date strings to proper datetime format  
- Normalized textual and numerical values  
- Counted number of unique users and hotels

### 2. Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- Used `Surprise` library's `KNNBasic` algorithm  
- Treated the `total` cost as an implicit rating  
- Evaluated with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- Final model achieved **RMSE ≈ 0.97**

### 3. Content-Based Filtering (CBF)
- Vectorized hotel names and places using TF-IDF  
- Computed hotel similarity using cosine similarity  
- Identified similar hotels based on user history

### 4. Hybrid Recommender System
- Combined CF and CBF with a weighted score  
- Final score = 70% CF prediction + 30% CBF similarity  
- Produced better personalized hotel recommendations

### 5. Streamlit Web Application
- Simple UI: Input user ID and get top hotel suggestions  
- Built using `streamlit` and deployed via `ngrok`  
- Real-time hotel recommendation system

# 👤2. Gender Classification API using BERT

This project is part of a larger **Travel & Tourism Capstone**, and focuses on predicting **gender from a person's name** using a deep learning model. The final system is accessible via a **REST API built with Flask**, trained in **Google Colab**, and deployed using **Docker**, **ngrok**, and **Jenkins**.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- `name`: First name or full name
- `gender`: Label (`Male` or `Female`)

Data Cleaning Steps:
- Removed null/duplicate values
- Normalized genders (lowercased)
- Label-encoded gender: `0 = Female`, `1 = Male`

---

## 🧪 Model Training

- **Tokenizer**: `BertTokenizer`
- **Model**: `BertForSequenceClassification`
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ✅ **> 60%**
- Fine-tuned on short name sequences
- Trained in **Google Colab** using GPU (if available)
